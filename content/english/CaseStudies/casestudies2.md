## Overview

<div style="text-align: left;">

Our client was using AWS infrastructure managed by Terraform and Ansible to deploy and maintain its applications. The company experienced a rapid increase in users and needed to scale its infrastructure efficiently. They chose to migrate to Kubernetes using Cluster-API, Helm, and Flux to improve their scalability and manageability.

<h2>Challenges</h2>

1. **Managing complex AWS infrastructure:**

   - Our client had a complex infrastructure setup on AWS, and managing it with Terraform and Ansible became time-consuming and error-prone.

2. **Scaling:**

   - The company’s rapid growth demanded a more efficient and flexible infrastructure solution for scaling.

3. **Transition:**
   - Migrating from the existing AWS setup to Kubernetes required a seamless transition without disrupting ongoing services.

<h2>Solution</h2>

1. **Cluster-API:**

   - Cloud Native Solution’s team chose Cluster-API to manage Kubernetes clusters on AWS. This allowed us to define, create, and manage the clusters using Kubernetes-style APIs and native Kubernetes manifests.

2. **Helm:**

   - Helm, a package manager for Kubernetes, was used to manage the deployment of applications. This enabled the team to package and share their applications as Helm charts, streamlining the deployment process.

3. **Flux:**
   - Flux, a GitOps tool, was used to automate the deployment and management of Kubernetes resources. This allowed the team to store their application configuration as code and automatically sync changes to the cluster.

<h2>Process</h2>

1. **Assessment:**

   - Cloud Native Solutions performed a thorough analysis of our client’s existing infrastructure and identified the components to be migrated to Kubernetes.

2. **Training:**

   - The client’s team received training on Kubernetes, Cluster-API, Helm, and Flux to better understand the migration process and the new tools.

3. **Migration Plan:**

   - A migration plan was created to ensure a smooth transition, including a timeline and milestones.

4. **Cluster Creation:**

   - Using Cluster-API, the team created Kubernetes clusters on AWS.

5. **Application Packaging:**

   - Applications were packaged as Helm charts for easy deployment on the new Kubernetes clusters.

6. **GitOps Implementation:**

   - Flux was configured to automate the deployment and management of the applications and their configurations.

7. **Testing:**

   - The team thoroughly tested the new setup to ensure everything was functioning correctly.

8. **Transition:**

   - Cloud Native Solutions transitioned our client’s services to the new Kubernetes infrastructure with minimal downtime.

9. **Monitoring and Optimization:**
   - The team monitored the new infrastructure and optimized it based on their learnings and requirements.
