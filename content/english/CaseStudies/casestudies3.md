## Overview

<div style="text-align: left;">

A leading software development company was using a container-based infrastructure deployed with Gitlab-CI in Amazon ECS and CloudWatch for logs and monitoring. In order to improve their processes and simplify their deployment, they decided to migrate their entire infrastructure to Kubernetes.

<h2>Challenges</h2>

1. **Complex Infrastructure:**

   - The existing setup included a self-hosted Gitlab instance and various tools, which had to be migrated to Kubernetes.

2. **Seamless Transition:**

   - The migration had to ensure a seamless transition with minimal downtime.

3. **Efficiency and Scalability:**
   - The new setup had to be efficient, secure, and easily scalable to accommodate the company’s future growth.

<h2>Solution</h2>

Cloud Native Solutions began by deploying an Amazon EKS cluster using kind and Cluster-API, which would serve as the management cluster. After successfully deploying the cluster, they moved the Cluster-API from kind to the newly created management cluster, making it self-managed.

Next, they deployed several essential tools in the management cluster, including:

- Cluster-API
- ArgoCD
- Prometheus + Grafana
- ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- Sentry
- Gitlab

The self-hosted Gitlab instance was migrated into Kubernetes, and ArgoCD was deployed for GitOps to manage the applications. This enabled the team to manage everything using Argo with Helm or simple manifests.

To ensure a well-structured environment, they deployed their tools to the management cluster using Argo and Helm charts. They also created Testing, Staging, and Production Kubernetes clusters with custom Helm charts for Cluster-API. The applications were deployed to workload clusters using Helm charts and Argo-CD.

<h2>Results</h2>

- **Improved deployment process:**

  - With Kubernetes and ArgoCD, deployments were streamlined and easy to manage.

- **Enhanced monitoring and logging:**

  - The Prometheus + Grafana and ELK stack provided better insights into the system’s performance and health.

- **Scalability:**

  - The use of Cluster-API and EKS enabled the company to scale its infrastructure effortlessly as per their needs.

- **Reduced downtime:**

  - The new setup allowed for seamless migration with minimal downtime, ensuring business continuity.

- **Efficient resource utilization:**
  - Kubernetes’ robust resource management capabilities optimized the company’s infrastructure.
